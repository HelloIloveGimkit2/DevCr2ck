# DevCr2ck
an exploit that allows you to gain chromeos DEVELOPER MODE privileges on the actual device

## How did you even find this
Multiple people have found this though I needed people to come out and say they had it happen too then also I would powerwash by doing esc+↻+⏻ (your board may not be compatible)

### is my board/chip compatible
here's the boards that this has been tested on these will probably all work:
dedede and octopus
however the boards that are listed as working with **br1ck** are probably going to work the one's that don't work:
**brya, brask, cherry, guybrush, skyrim, rex, nissa, corsola, staryu, geralt**

#### How do I do this now
You do this by performing **esc+↻+⏻ CTRL+D enter** and if it works the first time great! **If it doesn't then keep trying**
after you can enroll or you can continue doing [br1ck](https://br1ck.vercel.app). have a great time exploiting chromeos LOL!!!!!
